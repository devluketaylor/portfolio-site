# Top Places to Eat in Columbia, Missouri

This is my list of the best eats in Columbia. I have been a student at Mizzou for a year and I love eating so I figured I would make a list. This list includes on-campus dining options, off-campus favorites, coffee and chill spots, and sweet treats. Enjoy!

## **On-Campus Dining**

### 1. Mort's
- Mort's, in my opinion, has the best-tasting food on campus, though it’s also the most expensive. It has a variety of options, but their chicken strips reign supreme. Mort's has a really cool vibe, as well as pool tables and a vast amount of seating. It is a great spot to hang out with friends and enjoy some good food.

### 2. Plaza 900
- Plaza 900 is the largest dining hall on campus, offering a wide range of food. This was the first place I ate at on campus, I was impressed by the quality and variety of food available. After a while though, the food can get repetitive, but it is still a great place to eat. I recommend the deli and the mediterranean station.

### 3. Rollins Dining Hall
- Rollins dining hall, offers **Pizza & MO** and **Wings & MO**. The pizza is pretty good, but the wings are the best. There are a variety of flavors and customization options available for the pizza and wings. Keep in mind, you must order online and pick up your food. Typically it's a 30 minute to an hour wait time, they have it ready a little before the predicted time I find. Make sure to be looking for the notification that you're food is ready, after an extended period of time they will throw it out.
